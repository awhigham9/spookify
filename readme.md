Spookify is a simple Halloween themed browser extension that is meant to serve as an introduction to browser extension development.

A great way to use it is to incrementally add functionality, learning the structure and ability of browser extensions along the way.

This simple browser extension is derived from the Mozilla browser extension tutorials written by Mozilla contributors and found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_second_WebExtension and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension.

## Running the Extension

1. Go to "about:debugging" in Firefox.
2. Select "This Firefox" on the left hand side.
3. Select "Load Temporary Add-on..."
4. Navigate to where you have stored the extension on your computer, and select manifest.json

Once you've done this, click the pop-up at any time in your firefox session to use the extension!
